Dojo Rules
==========
* Always be on time
* Always take off your shoes
* Keep the dojo tidy
* Never bring live blades on the tatami
* Respect your opponents
* Most Senseis should be respected
* My test 2 (What does this refer to?  The source material has been ported over to Pluralsight, which Code School was absorbed into, and the project can be finished.  When writing a README markdown file, they really should be descriptive of what the function of the file was for.)
